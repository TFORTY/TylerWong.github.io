										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<h2 id="content">Hey there! My name is Tyler Wong.</h2>
										<p>I'm a game developer and designer with a passion for creating immersive and interactive experiences 
											that can connect and bring people together. I love creating and designing games with a player-first approach and giving players
											a comfortable and enjoyable experience. Currently I am developing games/passion projects in my freetime, 
											participating in game jams, refining my skills and learning new things!.
										</p>

											Games have always been a part of my life and have impacted me in several ways. Whether it be playing with friends and family, 
											laughing and having a good time, birthday parties, icebreakers, educational games, and even playing solo and facing 
											challenges to the point of tilting, games are never really there to provide only one experience. 
											They are meant to give people different experiences, those that players can create longlasting memories of. 
											Through games, I have met countless people, some that I can call my closest friends, and others that I have gotten to meet online 
											through different communities and servers. I've always known games as a form of entertainment, fun, a way to unwind and escape the 
											outside world.But to me, the close connections and fond memories that I can create and always look back on is what I cherish 
											and what makes games so impactful for me.									
										</p>
											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/rcpteam.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											For the past 4 years, I have continued my academic journey at Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, ON. Forming a student-run studio 
											by the name of <b><em>Raw Chicken Productions,</b></em>	I have gained experience designing several different games and applications. 	
											I originally wanted to get into gameplay programming within this industry but the I learned, developed games and took part of many events, 
											I found myself enjoying game design. Game design still allows me to code and deal with some technical aspects of game development but 
											I also get to use my creativity and imagination to bring characters, mechanics, systems and core gameplay to life. Through game design,
											I have also fallen in love with user interface design as well. I guess that's where I found that I can use my strengths 
											and my creativity to design a user experience that players can enjoy. 
											At Raw Chicken Productions, I have gone on to lead the design on several projects, 
											and playtesting efforts. I love working in an environment where team members can bounce ideas off one another 
											and are on the same wavelength. The feeling of understanding everyone's ideas and drive to deliver the best 
											quality product is a feeling like no other and exemplifies what game developmemnt is all about.
